'''
User-configurable Python plugin allowing for advanced functionality.
To use this plugin, you must specify

    plugin : "TRUE"

in the primary configuration ('config.yaml') file.

Security Note: be careful before running an untrusted plugin; if in doubt do not run before vetting the code.
This plugin can execute in a potentially more damaging way than the basic 'config.yaml' file which is read in 
a safe way.
